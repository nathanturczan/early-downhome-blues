# Melodic Contour

Source: Jeff Titon, *Early Downhome Blues*

## Overview

The contour of the entire stanza fits specific case IB. This is, in fact, the most common stanzaic contour in downhome blues.

To determine characteristic contours of the phrase, line, and stanza units, Titon counted, in each transcribed stanza, the number of occurrences of each specific contour case. Certain exceptional phrases did not count. The characteristic contours are shown in figure 69. He did not determine a separate contour in phrases e and f, because this kind of phrase division in line 3 is not always accomplished; but he did ascertain the contour of line 3 as a whole.

Figure 69 shows that the shape of all three structural units in downhome blues melody is well defined.

In the stanza unit, the predominant contour is general case I, a falling contour. By far the most common stanzaic contour is IB, a generally falling contour which rises from the starting pitch to the highest and falls eventually to the lowest, final pitch (fig 70).

Melodic contour of the line unit is similar to stanzaic contour; that is, it is described by general case I and specific case IB.

In the phrase unit, melodic contour shifts depending on the phrase. In phrase a, the first part of line 1, a rising contour is almost as frequent as a falling one. In phrase c, the first part of line 2, the same rising contour is significant.

## Definition

Melodic contour is the general shape of a sequence of pitches—rising, falling, terraced, undulating, level, and so on.

Alan Kagan has suggested the following scheme to describe contour. If we consider a sequence of pitches, the ones which define its shape are the starting (S), highest (H), lowest (L), and final (F) pitches.

## Contour Types

### Contour I: Falling (fig 65)

**General case I:** Starting pitch is higher than final pitch: S > F

| Case | Definition |
|------|------------|
| IA | S = H, F = L |
| IB | F = L, H > S |
| IC | S = H, F > L |
| ID<sub>a</sub> | H > S, F > L, H is achieved before L |
| ID<sub>b</sub> | H > S, F > L, L is achieved before H |

### Contour II: Rising
- IIA
- IIB
- IIC
- IID<sub>a</sub>
- IID<sub>b</sub>

### Contour III: Other
- IIIA
- IIIB
- IIIC
- IIID<sub>a</sub>
- IIID<sub>b</sub>
