# Figure 45: Stem-counts in the downhome blues sample
# Source: Jeff Titon, "Early Downhome Blues"
# Range: G3 to G5
#
# Microtone notation (Titon's terminology):
#   3qf = three-quarter-flat (below the flat, outside complex)
#   f = flat
#   f+ = flat slightly sharp (between flat and natural, closer to flat)
#   n- = natural slightly flat (between flat and natural, closer to natural)
#   n = natural
#   n+ = natural slightly sharp (above natural, outside complex)
#   f- = flat slightly flat (below standard flat)
#
# Complexes: E(346), G(471), B(108), E'(204)
