# Melodic Motion in Downhome Blues

Source: Jeff Titon, *Early Downhome Blues*

Note: Pitch names are capitalized (C, G, Bb). Phrase labels are lowercase (a, b, c, d, e, f).

## General Principles

- Melodic motion is more frequent and more gradual in the downward direction than the upward. The melody is likely to leap upward and descend stepwise, pausing at the complexes along the way.
- Stepwise motion in a single direction is more characteristic of downhome blues melody than pendular motion is.
- Equally common, however, is repetition of the previous pitch, especially as noted on the fifth degree of the scale.
- Skips upward are larger than those in the downward direction.
- Descent takes place by smaller intervals, rarely by more than thirds, except in slurs to the keynote C.

## Pitch Usage

### C and C'

- The keynote C and its octave C' are most frequently tonal rest points at the close of phrases b, d, and f.
- C is used with the E complex above, and it is usually approached from that complex (see fig 47; △ indicates a complex without specifying parts).
- C' is also used in connection with the E' complex above in a like manner, but it differs from its lower octave in that it functions with the G, A, and Bb below it.
- Motion upward from G to C' (sometimes through A) is common, especially at the beginnings of phrases a and c (fig 48).

### E and E' Complexes

- The E and E' complexes are most often alternated with the keynotes C and C'. However, there are significant differences in the complexes.
- When the E' complex is reached from C' below, E' itself is rarely reached first; that honor usually goes instead to Eb' or Eb slightly sharp' (i.e., E quarter-flat') (fig 49).
- But when the E complex is reached from C below, the E is often reached directly, and the typical movement is an upward arpeggio to G or pendular motion back to the keynote (fig 50).
- When it is Eb which is reached from C, there rarely is movement within the complex, and the melody typically moves back to C—Eb operating as a pendulum point.
- Although the E' complex is almost never reached from above, the E complex is reached thus very often, usually from G (sometimes through Gb and/or F, fig 51). In such cases, there is at least the occasion for motion within the G complex.
- Common uses of the E complex and the E' complex are summarized in Figure 52.

### G

- G may be reached in a variety of ways. For example, from C' above, often through the B complex or A (fig 53), or directly from the B complex or A (fig 54).
- It may be reached from below, from F, sometimes through F# or E (fig 55), or, less frequently, from C, but almost never from Eb.
- G is a versatile pitch of great importance, acting as a temporary resting place in some phrases, especially when several syllables must be sung in a short time, and figuring as the highest, most emphatic pitch in others (fig 56).
- As the root of the dominant chord, which often supplies the harmonic support for phrase e, it is regularly contrasted with B or Bb, sometimes through A, in pendular motion (fig 57).
- G also designates an important group of pitches in close proximity which function together. In this case, the G complex pitches are G, Gb, and Gb. The singer, in a sequence of G pitches, leans on some of them, lowering them for emphasis and contrasting them against the G.

### E, G, and F (Scale Degrees)

- The keynote major 3rd (E) and 5th (G) degrees of the scale are easily sung, for they make up the tonic triad which closes out each line and weights the song heavily.
- Since F, the fourth, can be sung easily near the start of phrase c, it is the root of the subdominant triad, which is the typical harmonic foundation for this phrase.
- One would expect F to be the common tone, but it is not, for singers prefer to repeat the phrase a melody against the subdominant support.
- F is most often a passing tone between the E complex and G, but F' is almost never used with the E' complex.
- Common uses of F are indicated in figure 60 (△ indicates a complex without specifying parts).

### A and D

- The sixth, A, functions principally as a passing tone between G and the Bb complex, or between G and C' (fig 61).
- D is rarely used and then only as a pendulum point with C.
- D' occurs both as a pendulum point with the E' complex and as a passing tone from the E' complex to C' (fig 62).

### Bb Complex

- The Bb complex functions like a combination of the G and the E complexes.
- It may be approached from the C' above, usually in phrases a and c, less often in phrases b and d (fig 53).
- In phrase e, as noted in figure 57, it plays a role as the highest and as a frequently employed pitch, usually approached from G or A below.
- The singer leaning on the B sometimes produces Bb slightly sharp or Bb.
- Singers sometimes even lean on C' and produce C' slightly flat for contrast.

### Motion Within the E and E' Complexes

- In the 44 downhome blues songs transcribed, 22 contain E or E' complexes consisting of Eb, E quarter-flat, and E, or their octaves—that is, all three pitches—while 31 contain these complexes with at least Eb and E, or their octaves.
- Motion within the E and E' complexes is not perfectly consistent. Singers may vary it to some extent to suit themselves, but certain tendencies are clear.
- Movement within the E complex is taken more slowly, and most often in an upward direction.
- If E is reached, that is a signal for exit downward, usually directly to C, but the singer does not need to reach E before moving out.
- When the E complex is reached from G above, a typical movement is G to Eb up through E and down to C (fig 61).
- In general, there is not so much movement within the E complex as within the E' complex because E is a much more important pitch than E'.
- The downhome blues scale (fig 46) shows E' only 47 times, while E figures 201 times.
- Stated differently, while E is sung more often than Eb and E quarter-flat, Eb' is sung much more often than E'.
- In short, E is the basic pitch in the E complex, but Eb' is the basic pitch in the E' complex.
- Indeed, E'—unlike E—is not a signal for direct exit downward to C'. The melody may progress downward within the complex, and the release may be from any of the pitches within it.
- Motion within the E and E' complexes is summarized in Figure 63.

## Toward Melodic Contour

Knowing that one pitch may move to certain other pitches is helpful but not sufficient for a song-producing model. One wants to know under which circumstances a given tone is likely to move to a particular tone. To determine these circumstances, we can investigate the shape of the melody of the phrase, line, and stanza units. It turns out that downhome blues melodies do have characteristic shapes in these units, hence we can predict melodic motion.
